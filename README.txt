This is my first machine learning personal project.

It's built taking into consideration a dataset of 9880 samples containing match results (in form of a binary column specifing if blue team won), with 38 features (19 for each team) + one unique ID for each match, totalizing 9879 rows and 40 columns.

This project's objective is to predict, based on game data of the first 10 minutes, whether the winner is the blue team or the red team.

The design choices, feature engineering and further explanation can be viewed at my corresponding Kaggle notebook for this project:
